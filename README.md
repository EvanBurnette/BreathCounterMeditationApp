# BreathCounterMeditationApp

## Introduction

This app is a simple clone of http://doasone.com/ with the added feature of breath counting. I made it to help me stay focused while meditating.

## Usage

Enter the meditation time in minutes and the breath duration in seconds. We're only counting the rise time of the breath here so 2x would be total breath cycle time (rising and falling). I have found what's comfortable for me is 7.5s, and I typically meditate for 15-20 minutes.

Each rise and fall is marked with the sound of breathing in and out. There is a bell that should sound when you reach the time goal.
